Description: We present CHAI (consensus Clustering tHrough similArIty matrix integratIon for single cell type identification), a wisdom of crowds approach for scRNAseq clustering. CHAI presents two methods which aggregate the clustering results from seven state of the art clustering methods: CHAI-AvgSim and  CHAI-SNF. Both methods demonstrate improved performance on a diverse selection of benchmarking datasets, including outperforming a previous consensus clustering method.
